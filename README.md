## Ph.D. at Iowa State University in the Hufford Lab

**Ph.D. in Plant Biology awarded January 2024**

My Ph.D thesis work centers on the genetic models of hybrid vigor and genome evolution across the genus *Zea* and *Tripsacum*. By understanding how evolutionary and population dynamics have affected the genome structure of maize and its wild relatives, and then relate those processes to phenotype, this research will provide foundational information to plant domestication, which can be used to improve existing crops or accelerate domestication of wild plants or orphan crops.

# Teaching 

**I teach to serve others and prepare students to tackle the problems of the 21st century.**

I believe that education can improve lives and help solve global and local challenges. 
In that spirit, I view classrooms as an environment where students can discover and apply new ways of thinking, forge connections, and engage their creativity and critical thinking skills. 
My role as an educator is build an environment and course frame work that enables these experiences and is supported by pedagogical research. 
I have a broad array of teaching experiences across institutions in biological sciences and general support. 
I am excited to pursue opportunities to develop course materials and teach classes in general biology, plant biology, evolutionary genetics, and computational skills for biologists.

# Service

I believe in supporting the scientific communities at local, national, and international scales through service. 
I have completed extensive service throughout my career such as supporting fellow graduate students, contributing to community databases, and assisting conference organization.
