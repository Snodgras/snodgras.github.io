_Human domestication of maize as bio-cultural coevolution_

Plant domestication and agriculture are key innovations underlying the expansion of human civilization. 
The process of domestication can result in tight dependencies between the domesticate and humans.
For instance, maize cannot persist outside of human cultivation yet has a global range, being brought to and adapted for extremely different environments by humans given its vital role as a food source. 
While much is known about where and when maize was domesticated from archeology and genetics research, there is limited understanding of how maize moved between early farmer communities as well as which traits were selected for and the strength of that selection during the initial period of the domestication process.
This project aims to use population genetics and create methods to address these long standing questions in maize, with the potential to apply these methods to other crops of the Americas. 
Understanding these dynamics could reveal why species vary in the ease of being domesticated at a genetic level and thus could be used to accelerate domestication efforts of _de novo_ crops or improvement efforts of locally important orphan crops.

## Ph.D. at Iowa State University in the Hufford Lab

**Ph.D. in Plant Biology awarded January 2024**

My Ph.D thesis centers on the genetic models of hybrid vigor and genome evolution across the genus *Zea* and *Tripsacum*. 
By understanding how evolutionary and population dynamics have affected the genome structure of maize and its wild relatives, and then relate those processes to phenotype, this research provides foundational information to plant domestication, which can be used to improve existing crops or accelerate domestication of wild plants or orphan crops.

# Teaching 

**I teach to serve others and prepare students to tackle the problems of the 21st century.**

I believe that education can improve lives and help solve global and local challenges. 
In that spirit, I view classrooms as an environment where students can discover and apply new ways of thinking, forge connections, and engage their creativity and critical thinking skills. 
My role as an educator is to build an environment and course that enables these experiences and is supported by pedagogical research. 
I have a broad array of teaching experiences across institutions in biological sciences and general academic support. 
I am excited to pursue opportunities to develop course materials and teach classes in general biology, plant biology, evolutionary genetics, and computational skills for biologists.

# Service

I believe in supporting the scientific communities at local, national, and international scales through service. 
I have completed extensive service throughout my career such as supporting graduate students, contributing to community databases, and assisting conference organization.
