# Teaching Philosophy

I truly believe that education can improve lives and encompasses more than the course topics. 
I am committed to building an environment where students can discover and apply new ideas in ways that are enhance their knowledge, forge connections between disciplines and current events, and engage their creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration skills. 
As a product of extensive, research-backed teaching methods, I know the power and potential of thoughtful and informed course design. 
I intend to continue implementing lessons from my previous experiences, but also look forward to potential partnerships with scholars of teaching and learning. 
Through the iterative process of experimentation, reflection, and research, I plan to continue improving my pedagogy and courses towards a better model of biology in higher education.
